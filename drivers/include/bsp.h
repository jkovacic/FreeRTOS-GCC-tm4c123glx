/*
 * Where multiple controllers of the same type are provided, their base addresses and IRQs
 * are defined as arrays. For IRQs this is pretty straightforward and arrays are simply defined
 * as values within curly brackets (e.g. "{ 3, 5, 8}"). That way it is simple to initialize
 * a statically declared array in source files where IRQs are necessary.
 * However, arrays of base addresses are a bit more tricky as addresses should be casted to
 * appropriate pointer types when assigned to pointers. This can be achieved using so called
 * "for-each macros". Within a macro definition, all addresses are enumerated as arguments to
 * another macro, e.g. CAST. Macros that are replaced by "CAST" are then defined in source files
 * when they are actually casted. For more details about this trick, see:
 * http://cakoose.com/wiki/c_preprocessor_abuse
