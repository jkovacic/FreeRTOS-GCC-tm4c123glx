 * Implementation of functions that manipulate both switches of
 * the Texas Instruments TM4C123GLX Launchpad directly,
 * without using general GPIO functions. This is an intermediate
 * layer, between a developer and appropriate GPIO handling functions
 * and no knowledge of switches' technical details is required.
 *
 * If additional switches are introduced, e.g. connected to additional
 * GPIO pins, it should be easy to expand the functions.
