 * Implementation of functions that enable or disable activation
 * of exceptions/interrupts and define the minimum priority for
 * exception processing.
 *
 * Note: this can only be achieved by modifying bits of system
 * registers (e.g. PRIMASK, BASEPRI) that are not mapped to the
 * memory, hence the functions must be at least partially
 * implemented in assembler.
 *
 * For more details, see
 * Cortex-M4 Devices, Generic User Guide (DUI553A):
