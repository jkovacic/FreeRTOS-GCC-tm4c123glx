/*
 * port.c from the officially supported GCC/ARM_CM4F port was reused for
 * TI TM4C123G*. The following changes were applied:
 *
 * - some stuff, already implemented by generic drivers, was removed from this file
 * - vPortSetupTimerInterrupt() was modified to use generic SysTick drivers
 * - context switching, implemented in xPortPendSVHandler(), also unpends the PendSV exception
 * - context switching, implemented in xPortPendSVHandler(), also supports situations when
 *   FPU and stacking its registers are disabled
 * - configuration of FPU and stacking its registers was removed from this file as
 *   it is implemented in the startup routine
 * - assembler instructions were rewritten in upper case for better readability
 * - all "annoying" tabs have been replaced by spaces
